#
## ‚ùî Information:
It's **not** a leak source code and ROMs but It's offical released source code. This Hack _(Binary Version)_ is Cancelled.
#
# ‚ùì QNA:
## Q1: What Happened Land94?

**Answer:** Land94 is an _alpha hack_ you'll want to play it. Developers said _"Yes, Land94 is most likely cancelled project, You want to leak it on
github."_ Land94 made with a **Binary Version / SM64 ROM Manager**, since project is `30 Nov 2021` .

## üò® WHY?
Developers wants to cancel Land94 project binary hack, Also they peoples mostly to see this source repo **(Be Careful!)**.

There's one lead owner says _"I'll make Land94 Decomp Remake but didn't like it binary version"_. That's sadly.

#
## Q2: Why did you ownership to me?
**Answer:** `ROM Owner` - Beta Penguin 64 _(aka. i am human)_ is an old owner developer.  
**In 1st December 2021**, Master Nama will started work developing Land94 and one is good developer DanilAstroid. Beta Penguin 64 said "you're developer is now yours to start developing hack." private dm, Beta Penguin 64 sent land94 dev server (confidential) and me to join dev server. After few minutes will make "Land94" YouTube Channel by me and this channel since 1st december 21.

**After few a days (working land94 aftermath version dev moment)** Beta Penguin 64 got tried to work land94 hack _(example: beta penguin 64 tried to work land94 hack having a stress and bored)_, I'm giving ownership _ROM Owner_ Beta Penguin 64 to Master Nama means it called "Lead Developer _Master Nama is now swapped ownership_".
DanilAstroid will added "Seconder Developer" he's good developer.



**In 6th April 2022**, Beta Penguin 64 _(aka. I am human)_ did uploaded land94 dev server leak link, because on Land94 Dev Server previously who did Thevobe gaved owner role and I am human will hack master nama and dustin yours. Me making "Pre-Mod" role and where to put Thevobe user, will started fighting chat. 

**In 7th April 2022**, I am human _(Owner of Server)_ will be result get banned for Master Nama on Land94 Dev Server reason due to thinking of aren't you an owner hack.

**In 8th April 2022**, I'm sorry for my fault because was didn't know who "I am human" and "Danil" guess it, I'll made it owner rom.
